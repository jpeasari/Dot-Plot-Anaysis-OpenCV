# Identifying RdDM strength based on the methylation pattern.

RNA directed DNA methylation (RdDM). A stretch of methylation signifies strong RdDM, whereas intermittent methylation 
suggest inefficient maintenance of methylation and not RdDM. Here, we were trying to differentiate long stretches from short stretches.

* Types of methylation

  CG - Cytosine is immediately follwed any a Guanine
  
  CHG - Cytosine followed by any nucleotide, expect Gaunine and immediately followed by A Guanine
  
  CHH - No Gaunine around Cytosine nucleotide
